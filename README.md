Bel BeautEssentials Cloud Migration and Architecture Design
This project focuses on the comprehensive analysis, design, and implementation of an AWS cloud migration and architecture solution for Bel BeautEssentials. It involves assessing the on-premises infrastructure and workloads, designing a scalable architecture using AWS services and Apache Hadoop, and creating architectural diagrams to aid in the migration process.

Project Goals
Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the on-premises infrastructure and workloads, assessing 100+ systems and applications for migration to the AWS cloud.
Design a robust and scalable high-level architecture utilizing AWS services such as EC2, S3, RDS, EMR, Lambda, CloudWatch, and Apache Hadoop.
Achieve a 40% reduction in infrastructure costs and improve system performance through effective architectural design and migration.
Create clear and visually appealing architectural diagrams to represent the migration process and facilitate stakeholder understanding and alignment with business objectives.
Prepare well-documented explanations and justifications for the chosen AWS services and migration approach, ensuring stakeholder buy-in and informed decision-making.

Technologies Used
AWS (Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, Amazon RDS, Amazon EMR, AWS Lambda, Amazon CloudWatch)
